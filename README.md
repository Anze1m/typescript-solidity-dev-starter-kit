# Typescript Solidity Dev Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts with a full Typescript environment. This stack uses [Buidler](https://buidler.dev) as the platform layer to orchestrate all the tasks. [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/index.html) is used for all Ethereum interactions and testing.
